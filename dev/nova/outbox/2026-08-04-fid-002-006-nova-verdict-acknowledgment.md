## Close-Out 1 — Claim 7: Verification Gates Re-Run (fresh, 2026-08-04)

Nova could not run the suite without the dev environment. Re-ran the FULL battery
at verdict time with actual tool output (all commands executed, not inferred):

```text
--- agent-runtime full suite ---
 0 fail / 1762 expect() calls / Ran 636 tests across 53 files.
--- common full suite ---
 0 fail / 1323 expect() calls / Ran 523 tests across 38 files.
--- github agent tests ---
 0 fail / 19 expect() calls / Ran 3 tests across 1 file.
--- DB + deep_research focused ---
 0 fail / 176 expect() calls / Ran 53 tests across 2 files.
--- typecheck x5 ---
sdk: OK / common: OK / packages/agent-runtime: OK / cli: OK / agents: OK
--- full ESLint ---
exit: 0 (--max-warnings 0)
```

All claims in the audit request's Claim 7 are independently reproduced: 636/0,
523/0, 3/0, typecheck ×5 exit 0, ESLint exit 0.

## Close-Out 2 — Claim 2: Full deep_research Registration Chain (grep evidence)

Nova requested the full registration chain be verified. Grep across the working
tree (all hits confirmed on disk):

- `common/src/tools/params/tool/deep-research.ts` — schema with
  `toolName: 'deep_research'` (2 hits)
- `common/src/tools/constants.ts` — `'deep_research'` at lines 50, 94
- `common/src/tools/list.ts` — `deep_research: deepResearchParams` (line 65)
- `common/src/tools/safety-registry.ts` — entry at line 74
- `packages/agent-runtime/src/tools/handlers/list.ts` — `handleDeepResearch`
  (line 79)
- `packages/agent-runtime/src/util/activity-tracking.ts` — lines 46, 219
- `agents/types/tools.ts` — `DeepResearchParams` (lines 52, 485)
- `agents/researcher/researcher-web.ts` — `deep_research` in `toolNames`
  (`['web_search', 'read_url', 'deep_research']`) + prompt documentation

## Close-Out 3 — Claim 5: browser-use Params on Disk (grep evidence)

Nova based Claim 5 on the FID without re-reading `browser-use.ts`. Confirmed on
disk:

- `agents/browser-use/browser-use.ts` — `viewport` (mobile 375x667 / tablet
  768x1024 / desktop 1920x1080), `wcag` (boolean), `persistSession` (boolean,
  default OFF) all present in `inputSchema.params` with the honest
  prompt-level-contract descriptions
- `agents/browser-use/browser-use.test.ts` — `responsive-mobile` (line 54) and
  `wcag-scan` (line 65) harness tasks present

---

## Final Status

**Nova signoff: PASS** — all 7 claims verified or closed out with fresh
tool-executed evidence on 2026-08-04. The 5 FIDs (002-006) remain `closed`
in `dev/fids/`; archival to `dev/fids/archive/` per ECHO Auto-Archive rule
remains pending (separate step).
