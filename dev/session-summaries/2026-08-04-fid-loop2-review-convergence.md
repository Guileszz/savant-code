## What happened

FreeBuff session: re-ran the Perfection Loop (RED → GREEN → AUDIT) on the 5 pending
FIDs authored earlier on 2026-08-04 (all at "RED complete, GREEN pending"). Each FID
was ground-truth verified against the working tree, converged through a new Loop 2
section, double-audited (manual re-read + independent reviewer), and presented for
user approval. No implementation was performed — FID-Bound Execution holds until
approval.

## RED findings (ground-truth verification)

- **FID-002 (Deep Research):** Researcher tool set verified (`researcher-web` =
  web_search/read_url, `researcher-docs` = read_docs); no `deep_research` exists.
  8 gaps: missing tool-wiring surface, Thinker coupling, ungrounded token budget,
  Serper concurrency cap, roster ambiguity, `depth` param collision with
  `web_search.depth`, missing test-infra patterns, output-format contract.
- **FID-003 (GitHub):** Auth/credentials pattern verified; AES-256 claim FALSE
  (plaintext `0600` only); roster conflict (helper, not roster member); `/provider
  github rotate` mis-scoped; existing MCP client + `browser-use` pattern ignored.
- **FID-004 (Database):** "No existing database integration" FALSE —
  `packages/database/` (bun:sqlite persistence) exists; real gap = interactive
  user-DB querying; Supabase claim unevidenced; per-engine SQL semantics, adapter
  safety boundary, scope creep (migrations/RLS/backup) surfaced.
- **FID-005 (Browser):** CRITICAL — `browser-use` + `chrome-devtools-mcp` already
  implement the core proposal (accessibility-tree interaction, screenshots, console/
  network monitoring). Rescoped to param upgrades (viewport, WCAG/axe-core, optional
  persistence); pooling/cross-browser deferred.
- **FID-006 (Master Plan):** Roster (9 canonical + 4 infra helpers) and ECHO.md 722
  lines verified; problem statement inaccurate (3 of 4 items), roster-inflation plan
  conflicts with FID-2026-0803-013, sequential-sequencing claim false, Playwright
  size premise moot after FID-005 rescope.

## Changes (FID documents only — no code)

- All 5 FIDs: Loop 2 section appended (RED evidence with file:line citations, GREEN
  converged solution, AUDIT), Perfection Loop metadata line updated, FID History
  entries added, Status kept `analyzed` (pre-implementation).
- Children (002-005) gained `Master FID: FID-2026-0804-006` metadata (GAP-1 fix).
- SELF-CORRECT pass (independent reviewer findings): stale original sections marked
  `> SUPERSEDED by Loop 2` (AES-256 criterion, roster claims, Playwright, migration
  generation, pooling, etc.); FID-003 GitHub server distribution contract pinned as
  implementation gate (Docker vs binary vs native fallback); FID-004 driver
  recommendations rephrased as audit-subject proposals; helpers-count wording
  clarified to "spawnable infra helpers".

## Verification

- Double audit: (1) manual re-read of all 5 converged FIDs + spot-verification of
  every RED citation against source (browser-use mcpServers 129-136, credentials
  0600 at provider-setup.ts:243 / sdk credentials.ts:173-177, MCP env field at
  types/mcp.ts:10, ECHO.md = 722 lines via `wc -l`, roster at ECHO.md:24-34); (2)
  independent code-reviewer-glm audit — all citations confirmed accurate, 2 critical
  + 3 minor SELF-CORRECT items raised and resolved.
- No build/test gates run: no code changed (FID-Bound Execution). Per-phase gates
  are documented in each FID's AUDIT section for implementation time.

## Status

Awaiting user approval to implement. On approval: FIDs proceed to COMPLETE per phase
(order-independent; phases may run in parallel), implementation follows the
converged GREEN sections, CHANGELOG + ARCHITECTURE/ECHO.md updates land per phase,
and each FID is archived after implementation verification.

## Artifacts

- 5 FIDs updated in `dev/fids/` (untracked, pre-existing from the earlier session).
- This session summary.
