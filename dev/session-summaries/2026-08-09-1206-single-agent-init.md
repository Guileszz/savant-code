# Session Summary: 2026-08-09 12:06

**Session ID:** 2026-08-09-1206-single-agent-init
**Duration:** 2026-08-09 12:06 EDT — (open)
**Status:** active

**Governing protocol:** Single-agent ECHO v0.1.2 (`dev/echo-v0.1.2-single-agent.md`,
`single_agent.protocol` in `protocol.config.yaml`, `strict_mode: true`).
The harness ECHO.md (v0.2.0) does not govern this session.

---

## Initial State

### Environment

- **OS:** Windows (win32), bash shell
- **Language/Runtime:** TypeScript strict monorepo; Bun 1.3.14
- **Branch:** `main`
- **Last Commit:** `37ebd8e docs: add completed release session handoff`

### Active FIDs (dev/fids/)

| FID | Severity | Status | Note |
|-----|----------|--------|------|
| FID-2026-0808-001 Reversible Public Release Pipeline | high | implemented | specification+implementation verified locally; no release executed |
| FID-2026-0808-002 Zero-Command Token-Native Release | high | implemented — audit pending | amends 001; automation via GITHUB_TOKEN |
| FID-2026-0808-003 Deterministic Release Gates & Failure Recovery | critical | verified | implementation-blocking remediation for 001/002; resolved |
| FID-2026-0809-001 Unified Provider Registry | high | analyzed | **Nova implementation sign-off = PASS (inbox 2026-08-09). Ready to close + archive.** |
| FID-2026-0809-002 Release Binary Asset Verification + Frozen-Lockfile Gate | critical | fixed | archival trigger = next release publishes with assets |

### Known Issues

- **`ECHO.md` markdownlint failures** (7 × MD013/MD032 at lines 100, 284, 286, 414,
  629, 638, 668) from operator working-tree edits (EHEL docs). Blocks the pre-push
  `bun run lint:md` gate. Not from any FID work.
- **Doc drift in `ECHO-single-agent.md` marker:** it references
  `dev/nova/specs/echo-v0.1.2-single-agent.md` and `FREEREADME.md`, but neither exists.
  The authoritative spec lives at `dev/echo-v0.1.2-single-agent.md` (read 0-EOF this
  session). Flag for correction in a future session.
- **Worktree:** 77+ modified/deleted files, uncommitted (provider-registry work,
  release-gate work, operator ECHO.md edits). Do NOT auto-commit; operator controls
  commits.
- Pre-existing lint note from handoff: repo lint gates otherwise clean as of the
  2026-08-09-0323 session.

### Dependencies

- **Nova verdict for FID-2026-0809-001: PASS** (implementation sign-off received in
  `dev/nova/inbox/2026-08-09-fid-2026-0809-001-unified-provider-registry-implementation-sign-off-response.md`).
  Working-tree-only mutation boundary confirmed; HEAD unchanged at `37ebd8e`.
- No release, tag, push, or publish authorized this session.

## Planned Work

1. [ ] Close + archive FID-2026-0809-001 (Nova PASS received) — status Closed,
      move to `dev/fids/archive/`, append CHANGELOG entry (drafted in the 0323
      handoff), log archival here.
2. [ ] Surface the worktree split (provider work / release work / ECHO.md edits) for
      operator commit decision. Do not auto-commit.
3. [ ] Fix `ECHO.md` markdownlint failures (or coordinate with operator) so the
      pre-push gate passes.
4. [ ] Operator-defined work for the session (pending user direction).
5. [ ] Update this summary + LEARNINGS.md at session close.

## Overnight Implementation Verification (2026-08-09 ~12:10)

Mechanically verified every FID claim against the working tree (FID Ground-Truth
rule — metadata is a claim, code is ground truth). All code implementation is
**present and green**; nothing has been committed or released.

### FID-2026-0809-001 — Unified Provider Registry ✅ (Nova PASS + tree-verified)

- `common/src/providers/` all present: `registry.ts`, `derive.ts`, `model-catalogs.ts`,
  `org.ts`, `types.ts`, `validate.ts`, `index.ts` + `__tests__/`
- `sdk/src/impl/model-provider/default-inference.ts` (rename from `savant-backend.ts`;
  old file absent), `model-factories.ts` present
- CLI single-setting state: `settings.ts` `activeProvider` (lines 79, 257-274, 436-458);
  `provider-setup.ts:29` derives; `model-picker.tsx:50` derives order
- `scripts/generate-provider-reference.ts` present; `.env.example` +
  `cli/release/README.md` have the GENERATED marker blocks
- Drift-kill greps clean: no `createSavantCodeBackendModel` (doc comment only),
  no `tokenrouter.me`, no catalog arrays (doc comments only), `savant-backend.ts` gone
- Nova implementation sign-off: **PASS** (inbox, all 3 targets file:line evidence)

### FID-2026-0809-002 — Release Binary Asset Verification ✅ (tree-verified)

- `bun install --frozen-lockfile` → **exit 0** (lockfile regenerated)
- `lockfile` gate in `buildGateManifest` (`scripts/public-release.ts:439-444`)
- `verifyReleaseAssets` (`scripts/public-release.ts:2143`) with 5-tarball
  `RELEASE_BINARY_TARBALLS` (`:120-126`)
- `.github/workflows/build-release-binaries.yml:165` `verify-release-assets` job
- Legacy scripts gone: `cli/scripts/release.ts`, `sdk/scripts/release.js`,
  `savant-free/cli/release.ts` all absent; no `release:*` chains in the 4 manifests;
  `savant-free-private` only remains as a SPEC.md doc note

### FID-2026-0808-001/002/003 — Release pipeline engine ✅ (present, NOT executed)

- `release:public` / `:preview` / `:resume` / `:diagnose` scripts in root package.json
- `SAVANT_CODE_RELEASE_AUTOMATION=1` flag (`public-release.ts:269`);
  `GITHUB_TOKEN ?? GH_TOKEN` (`:275`); receipt v2 + stage list
  (GATES_AND_PACKAGE_DRY_RUNS → … → POST_RELEASE_VERIFY)

### Validation gates (all run this session)

| Gate | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `bun install --frozen-lockfile` | exit 0 |
| common typecheck + provider tests | exit 0 · 21/0 |
| sdk typecheck + free-mode tests | exit 0 · 11/0 |
| cli typecheck + settings/provider-setup | exit 0 · 34/0 |
| `scripts/public-release.test.ts` | 52/53 (sole fail pre-existing env-dependent) |
| `bun run generate:provider-docs:check` | exit 0 |

### What is NOT done (important)

1. **Nothing is committed** — 79 files uncommitted; HEAD still `37ebd8e`. No tag,
   push, or publish was executed (mutation boundary held).
2. **`@savant-code/sdk` is NOT on npm** (E404) — never published.
3. **`v0.0.21` GitHub release still has 0 binary assets** — Step 6 remediation
   (dispatch the binary workflow to heal v0.0.21) was NOT executed; fresh
   `savant-code@0.0.21` installs still fail, users still run the v0.0.20 binary.
4. FID-2026-0809-001 not yet closed/archived (now authorized — Nova PASS).
5. FID-2026-0809-002 archival pending next release with assets.
6. `ECHO.md` 7 markdownlint errors remain (operator working-tree edits).

---

## FID Closure + Archival (2026-08-09 ~12:30)

Operator-directed close of all five active FIDs (all implementations verified in-tree and Nova
approved):

1. **FID-2026-0808-001** (Reversible Public Release Pipeline) → `closed` + archived — Nova
   second-approval sign-off granted (extends 001/002/003).
2. **FID-2026-0808-002** (Zero-Command Token-Native Release) → `closed` + archived — Nova PASS,
   pre-push sign-off GRANTED.
3. **FID-2026-0808-003** (Deterministic Release Gates) → `closed` + archived — Nova
   second-approval sign-off granted.
4. **FID-2026-0809-001** (Unified Provider Registry) → `closed` + archived — Nova implementation
   sign-off PASS (inbox 2026-08-09).
5. **FID-2026-0809-002** (Release Binary Asset Verification) → `closed` + archived —
   implementation `fixed` + verified; live v0.0.21 asset remediation tracked in the A-Z session.

CHANGELOG updated with three entries (0808 batch, 0809-001, 0809-002). `dev/fids/` now holds
zero active FIDs. All five files moved to `dev/fids/archive/`.

---

## Build/Release A-Z Audit + Fixes (2026-08-09 ~12:45)

Created `dev/test-prompts/az-test-build-release-system.md` (T1-T6 tiers) and ran the full
read-only audit; results in `dev/scratchpad/az-test-build-release-system-results.md`.
**Verdict: GO** for the next operator-approved release.

All green: `release:public:preview` exit 0 (correct plan + changelog section + 5 asset
names); contract suite 52/53 (sole pre-existing env-dependent failure); `bun install
--frozen-lockfile` exit 0; workflow 5-target matrix + `verify-release-assets` job;
build-binary env gate 13/0; launcher URLs point at `savant0x/savant-code`; both npm
pack dry-runs correct; SDK build + verify exit 0; versions aligned 0.0.21; typecheck ×5
exit 0; ESLint clean; lint:md clean; prettier clean on changed files.

**Fixes applied:**

1. `ECHO.md` — 7 MD013 line-length + 2 MD032 list-blank fixes (release-gate blocker).
2. `.markdownlintignore` — added dated `docs/design/Enterprise AI Gateway Research.md`
   (deep-research artifact, same precedent as other dated design docs).
3. `git rm scripts/release.py scripts/sync-agents.py` — legacy foreign-repo
   (`fame0528/savant-protocol`) release helpers, documented not-reused in FID-0808-001.

**Outstanding (operator action):** commit the ~100-file worktree, bump to 0.0.22, then
run `release:public`. v0.0.21 asset healing **abandoned by operator** (see Release
Direction section); SDK publish happens as part of the 0.0.22 release. No
release/tag/push/npm mutation performed.

---

## Nova Sign-Off Request Filed (2026-08-09 ~13:00)

Filed `dev/nova/outbox/2026-08-09-fid-closures-and-build-release-az-sign-off-request.md`
covering the FID closure batch (5 FIDs, each backed by an on-record Nova verdict) + the
A–Z build/release fixes (ECHO.md lint remediation, dated-doc `.markdownlintignore`
exemption, legacy `release.py`/`sync-agents.py` removal). Seven audit targets; mutation
boundary stated: working-tree only, HEAD `37ebd8e`, no public mutations. Awaiting Nova's
verdict in `dev/nova/inbox/`.

---

## Nova Verdict Received + Mailbox Archival (2026-08-09 ~13:20)

Nova's verdict landed in `dev/nova/inbox/2026-08-09-fid-closures-and-build-release-az-sign-off-response.md`:
**ALL 7 TARGETS PASS** — FID closure correctness, 0809-002 honest close, ECHO.md lint fix,
`.markdownlintignore` precedent, legacy script removal, build/release green, no overreach.
One non-blocking scope note recorded faithfully: the ECHO.md diff includes the operator's
own substantive edits from last night (EHEL section, mode rewrite, threshold changes) in
addition to the requested line reflows — a request-scope description inaccuracy, not a
work defect.

Per Nova's instruction, the mailboxes were cleared of all resolved items:

- **Inbox (7 files → `dev/nova/inbox/archive/`):** the four 0808 release-pipeline responses
  (001, 002, second-approval audit response + SIGN-OFF), the two 0809-001 responses
  (nova-audit + implementation sign-off PASS), and the 0809 closures/A-Z sign-off response.
- **Outbox (3 files → `dev/nova/outbox/archive/`):** the 0809-001 nova-audit request, the
  0809-001 implementation sign-off request, and the 0809 closures/A-Z sign-off request.
- Both mailboxes now hold only `archive/` + `.gitkeep` — zero pending items.

Citation convention honored: existing references in CHANGELOG/archived FIDs/session
summaries keep their original `dev/nova/inbox/…`/`dev/nova/outbox/…` paths (historical
records; matches the repo precedent for long-archived items, e.g. CHANGELOG:623).

## Release Direction: v0.0.21 Heal Abandoned, 0.0.22 Next (2026-08-09 ~13:45)

Operator decision: **do NOT dispatch the binary workflow to heal v0.0.21** (FID-0809-002
Step 6 formally abandoned). The 0.0.21 GitHub release stays at 0 binary assets; the next
release is **0.0.22**, which will carry fresh binaries + the `verify-release-assets` job.

`release:public:preview` re-run: **GO** — but it exposed two release blockers:

1. **Version still 0.0.21 everywhere** (15 manifests + `VERSION`). The engine reads
   `currentVersion(root)`; without a bump, the release would re-tag `v0.0.21` (exists).
   Prerequisite: bump to 0.0.22 (`VERSION` first, then propagate per release-workflow
   skill) + add the `## v0.0.22` CHANGELOG section (engine uses it as the release body).
2. **100 files uncommitted** — critical, because `release:public` pushes `main` and
   creates the tag from committed state. The provider registry + the workflow
   `verify-release-assets` job exist ONLY in the working tree (0 occurrences on
   `origin/main`). The worktree MUST be committed before the release runs, or 0.0.22
   would build from stale `37ebd8e` source.

0.0.22 flow (once prereqs met): `release:public` → tag + push → GitHub release
(`release: published` auto-triggers the binary workflow → 5 tarballs uploaded + verify
job asserts them) → `npm publish` CLI + SDK.

---

## Open Questions

- Which work item should this session execute first (close 0809-001, fix ECHO.md
  lint, add providers, other)?
- Should `ECHO-single-agent.md`'s stale references be corrected this session?

---

## Next Session Notes

- Verify FID status against codebase before reporting (FID ground-truth rule).
- `bun run generate:provider-docs` after any provider registry change.
- Validation gates: typecheck × 4 (sdk/common/agent-runtime/cli), `bun test` suites,
  `bun x eslint . --max-warnings 0`, `bun run lint:md`, `bunx prettier --check .`.
