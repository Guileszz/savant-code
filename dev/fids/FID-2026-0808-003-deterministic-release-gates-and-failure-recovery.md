# FID: Deterministic Release Gates and Failure Recovery

**Filename:** `FID-2026-0808-003-deterministic-release-gates-and-failure-recovery.md`
**ID:** FID-2026-0808-003
**Severity:** critical
**Status:** verified
**Created:** 2026-08-08
**YAGNI-Compliance:** Confirmed — the universal structured gate layer is exercised by the real
diagnostic run; no speculative abstractions were added beyond the evidence requirements.

---

## Summary

The token-native public release workflow has reached the local release commit but cannot safely
advance because its full test gate reports contradictory outcomes: the release subprocess has
reported 37 failures and 9 errors, while an independent execution of the same build → typecheck →
test sequence exits 0. The runner reduces the failure to a generic stage message and does not attach
an actionable, secret-safe command transcript to the receipt. Repeated resume attempts therefore
repeat an unclassified failure instead of proving whether the problem is a real assertion failure,
a child-process signal, generated-artifact contamination, environment leakage, output truncation, or
a flaky test harness.

This FID is an implementation-blocking remediation for FID-2026-0808-001 and
FID-2026-0808-002. No tag, push, GitHub release, or npm publication is authorized until the gate
failure can be classified deterministically and the receipt can support a safe operator decision.

---

## Environment

- **OS:** Windows development workstation (`win32`)
- **Language/Runtime:** TypeScript monorepo; Bun runtime; npm; Git
- **Tool Versions:** Bun project requirement `1.3.14`; installed out-of-band at
  `C:\Users\spenc\.bun-1.3.14\bin\bun.exe` (verified `bun --version` → `1.3.14`); observed npm `10.9.2`
- **Commit/State:** `main`, local release commit `7cb6184439a45fb781985d2d5acf4c22941c78e9`
- **Public version:** `0.0.21`
- **Release receipt:** `/tmp/savant-public-release-0.0.21.json`
- **Mutation state:** worktree clean; local `v0.0.21` tag absent; no public package version published

---

## Detailed Description

### Problem

The automated release was authorized by Nova and correctly stopped before public mutation when its
test stage failed. The same receipt-backed resume was attempted multiple times. The reported result
was not stable. The `37 fail / 9 errors` values are the runner's separate Bun summary
categories and must not be assumed additive without parsing the full transcript.
The existing evidence is therefore classified as **unresolved**, not as a reproducible
count:

```text
Release subprocess observation:
  command: SAVANT_CODE_RELEASE_AUTOMATION=1 bun run release:public:resume
  gate: bun run test
  reported summary: 2,900 tests; 2,845 pass; 18 skip; 37 fail; 9 errors
  surfaced failure: Stage command failed: bun run test
  timestamp/profile hash: not persisted by the current runner (evidence gap)

Independent exact-profile/build-sequence observation:
  environment: SAVANT_CODE_DEFAULT_MODEL_ID=openrouter/free,
               SAVANT_CODE_MODEL_PROVIDER=openrouter
  commands: bun run build:sdk → bun run typecheck → bun run test
  observed result: all commands exit 0
  timestamp/profile hash: not persisted by the current runner (evidence gap)
```

The remediation must capture exact timestamps, Bun/npm versions, cwd, command manifest,
non-secret environment/profile hash, exit/signal classification, and complete redacted
transcripts for both outcomes before declaring the discrepancy understood.

The available `/tmp` logs are large, but the failure diagnostic previously inspected only tail or
filtered output and did not produce a durable failure block with test names, stack traces, signal
status, or the exact command environment. The release receipt records only a generic `failedStage`
string. This is insufficient for a critical release transaction.

### Expected Behavior

For every gate command, the release runner must:

1. Execute the exact command with an explicit, reproducible working directory and sanitized
   environment contract. Add the exact read-only entrypoint `bun run release:public:diagnose`.
   Its canonical manifest and order are exactly: `bun run build:sdk`, `bun run typecheck`,
   `bun run test`, `bun x eslint . --max-warnings 0`, `bun run lint:md`,
   `bunx prettier --check .`, `npm pack --dry-run` in `sdk/`, and `npm pack --dry-run` in
   `cli/release/`. It may never invoke tag, push, GitHub release, or npm publish.
2. Distinguish a normal non-zero exit, a signal termination, a spawn/OS error, timeout, and malformed
   result rather than collapsing them into one error. Before any snapshot/profile mutation, require
   the project-pinned Bun version (`1.3.14` per `package.json`) and npm `10.x` (the supported
   contract for this release); a runtime mismatch is a hard preflight failure, not a diagnostic
   warning. The observed Bun `1.3.11` must therefore be corrected or explicitly supported in the
   project/toolchain contract before release execution.
3. Capture complete stdout and stderr without allowing output volume to hide the failure summary.
   Use streamed file-backed capture or concurrently drained pipes; do not rely on an unbounded
   in-memory `spawnSync` pipe that can deadlock or truncate on Windows.
4. Persist a secret-redacted transcript outside the repository and reference it from the receipt.
   Write the redacted transcript atomically, hash the final bytes after redaction, and never expose
   the raw transcript if redaction or persistence fails.
5. Record command, cwd, start/end timestamps, duration, exit code, signal, attempt number, and a
   bounded human-readable failure summary.
6. Restore local state and atomically persist the final receipt on every post-snapshot path. If
   receipt or transcript persistence fails, fail closed, report only the non-secret persistence path
   and category, and refuse resume because evidence integrity is unknown.
7. Never retry or bypass a public mutation stage automatically.
8. Require an explicit policy for gate retries; a passing retry must not silently erase the prior
   failure or authorize mutation without the required evidence.
9. Make `--resume` consume the receipt only when the release mode, commit binding, gate evidence,
   and current worktree state are compatible. Use receipt schema `release-receipt/v2`; invalidate the
   existing pre-diagnostics receipt because it has no transcript, gate attempts, failure class, or
   evidence hash.

### Root Cause

The release runner's `run()` helper invokes `spawnSync` with `stdio: 'inherit'` for effectful gate
commands, returns only `status`, `stdout`, and `stderr`, and discards the child `signal` and spawn
error. `runRequired()` then throws only `Stage command failed: <command> <args>`. The runner writes a
JSON receipt, but it contains no command transcript, gate attempt record, log path, or failure class.

The root test command is a sequential workspace chain in `package.json`, and the repository Bun
configuration preloads `sdk/test/setup-env.ts`. The SDK build also regenerates artifacts before the
test gate. Those facts make process state, generated output, preload environment, and child-process
termination relevant hypotheses, but the current runner does not record enough evidence to distinguish
them.

The current implementation evidence is:

```text
scripts/public-release.ts:332-351
run() uses spawnSync and returns status/stdout/stderr but does not expose signal or spawn error.

scripts/public-release.ts:353-371
runRequired() converts every non-zero result into the generic
"Stage command failed: <command> <args>" message.

scripts/public-release.ts:946-957
withLocalStateRestoration() restores local state in finally after the snapshot is created.

scripts/public-release.ts:1200-1208
The outer catch records only error text in failedStage; the final receipt does not carry a
structured command result or transcript reference.

package.json:36-37
The root test command chains workspace tests sequentially; the typecheck command likewise chains
workspace typechecks.

bunfig.toml:1-8
The root Bun configuration preloads sdk/test/setup-env.ts for test execution.

/tmp/savant-public-release-0.0.21.json
The receipt records completed stages through PUBLIC_PROFILE, restored=true, and
failedStage="Stage command failed: bun run test"; it contains no structured gate transcript.
```

### Failure and Recovery Edge Cases

The remediation must explicitly handle all of these cases:

1. **Assertion failure:** child exits non-zero with test failures; preserve the complete failure
   summary and do not treat a later unrelated pass as proof without an explicit retry policy.
2. **Signal termination:** `status` is null and `signal` is present; classify separately and fail
   closed without automatic retry unless a future policy explicitly permits that signal.
3. **Spawn/OS failure:** Bun/npm/Git cannot be started; record the OS error without leaking command
   environment values.
4. **Timeout or hung child:** terminate only the owned child process tree where supported, record
   timeout duration and termination result, and never proceed to mutation. On Windows, use a tested
   process-tree strategy (for example a job object or a narrowly scoped task termination) and verify
   no owned descendant remains before releasing the lock; do not kill unrelated processes.
5. **Output truncation/backpressure:** retain the full transcript in an external log while keeping
   the receipt summary bounded; do not infer success from a truncated tail.
6. **Secret-bearing output:** redact known API/token/password/authorization forms before log and
   receipt persistence; never place Git auth headers in argv or logged environment dumps.
7. **Generated artifacts:** record the build/test boundary and verify whether generated files are
   ignored, tracked, or changed; a failed gate must not silently contaminate the next resume.
8. **Shared process environment:** public profile variables must be applied only inside the snapshot
   and restoration boundary; child commands must receive an explicit environment snapshot.
9. **Partial receipt write:** receipt writes must be atomic so a crash cannot create a syntactically
   valid but semantically mixed stage record.
10. **Crash after auto-commit:** recovery may accept only the exact expected release commit whose
    parent is the receipt-bound HEAD, subject matches the version, and worktree is clean.
11. **Resume mode mismatch:** automation receipts must not resume through manual `gh` mode, and
    manual receipts must not resume through REST automation.
12. **Resume after gate failure:** resume must not skip a failed gate merely because earlier stages
    are complete; it must rerun or explicitly invalidate the failed evidence.
13. **Concurrent release processes:** a second process must not reuse or overwrite the same receipt or
    log without an ownership/lock check.
14. **Npm package first publication:** an absent package is not an access failure; an existing package
    still requires ownership/access verification; registry `404` output formats vary by npm version.
15. **Network/API failure:** GitHub 401/403/429/5xx, malformed JSON, timeout, and unexpected 404
    semantics must remain fail-closed and distinguishable from local test failures.
16. **Restoration failure:** if settings/environment restoration fails, the release must exit non-zero
    and identify only non-secret paths requiring operator attention.
17. **No public mutation:** no tag, push, GitHub release, or npm publication may run after any
    unclassified or failed local gate.
18. **Nondeterministic test result:** one later pass must not erase a prior failure from the audit
    record; the receipt must retain every attempt and the final policy decision.
19. **Canonical reproducibility identity:** serialize a manifest as UTF-8 JSON with recursively
    lexicographically sorted object keys, arrays preserved in declared order, no insignificant
    whitespace, and explicit `null` values. Include release version, exact gate commands/arguments,
    cwd, Bun/npm versions, relevant non-secret environment values, and profile mode; hash the UTF-8
    serialization with SHA-256. A gate result from a different manifest hash cannot satisfy resume.
20. **Npm/network classification:** package absence must be recorded as an authenticated registry
    response classified as HTTP 404/not-found; DNS, timeout, 401/403, proxy, and registry errors
    must never be interpreted as package absence.
21. **Transcript confidentiality:** transcripts must be written outside the repository with restrictive
    permissions where supported, bounded retention/cleanup, and fail-closed behavior if redaction
    cannot confidently classify a secret-bearing line. If redaction throws, encounters invalid encoding,
    or encounters an unclassified credential-shaped line, discard the raw stream and persist only a
    sanitized failure category; never retain raw output as a fallback.
22. **Transcript/receipt pair finalization:** write the transcript atomically, hash the final redacted
    bytes, then atomically write a receipt that references that hash and a finalization marker. Resume
    is valid only when both files exist, hashes match, and the marker is complete; independently valid
    files must not create a resumable mixed state.
23. **Lock ownership:** lock acquisition must be atomic and record PID, process start time, host,
    release version, mode, and receipt/log paths. A live owner blocks a second run; stale-lock
    recovery requires explicit evidence that the owner is gone and must never delete an active lock.
24. **Windows process cleanup:** timeout handling must use a tested owned-process-tree mechanism and
    verify every owned descendant is gone before releasing the lock or declaring restoration complete;
    it must never terminate unrelated processes.
25. **Suspended approvals:** FID-2026-0808-001 and FID-2026-0808-002 remain implemented but their
    earlier execution approvals are suspended by this critical remediation until FID-003 receives
    fresh AUDIT and ADVERSARIAL sign-off.
26. **Existing local state:** this investigation does not imply a pristine repository; the approved
    local release commit `7cb6184` already exists. The no-mutation boundary prohibits additional
    commits, tags, pushes, releases, publications, and durable settings changes.
19. **Npm/network classification:** package absence must be recorded as an authenticated registry
    response classified as HTTP 404/not-found; DNS, timeout, 401/403, proxy, and registry errors
    must never be interpreted as package absence.
20. **Transcript confidentiality:** transcripts must be written outside the repository with restrictive
    permissions where supported, bounded retention/cleanup, and fail-closed behavior if redaction
    cannot confidently classify a secret-bearing line. The receipt stores only a path, hash, summary,
    and redaction status. Transcript files are atomically replaced; a missing hash or redaction status
    invalidates resume.
21. **Lock ownership:** lock acquisition must be atomic and record PID, process start time, host,
    release version, mode, and receipt/log paths. A live owner blocks a second run; stale-lock
    recovery requires explicit evidence that the owner is gone and must never delete an active lock.
22. **Existing local state:** this investigation does not imply a pristine repository; the approved
    local release commit `7cb6184` already exists. The no-mutation boundary prohibits additional
    commits, tags, pushes, releases, publications, and durable settings changes.

## Impact Assessment

### Affected Components

- `scripts/public-release.ts` — command execution, gate orchestration, receipt, resume, restoration
- `scripts/public-release.test.ts` — subprocess-result, logging, retry, receipt, and mutation-boundary tests
- `docs/public-release.md` — operational behavior and failure/retry documentation
- `dev/fids/FID-2026-0808-001-reversible-public-release-pipeline.md` — parent release contract/evidence
- `dev/fids/FID-2026-0808-002-zero-command-token-native-release.md` — automation contract/evidence
- `/tmp` release receipt/log artifacts — ignored diagnostic evidence, never tracked or published
- Root workspace scripts and Bun test preload configuration — gate determinism inputs

### Risk Level

- [x] Critical: System crash, data loss, or security vulnerability
- [ ] High: Major feature broken, no workaround
- [ ] Medium: Feature degraded, workaround exists
- [ ] Low: Minor issue, cosmetic, or edge case

The immediate risk is not that the workflow publishes prematurely—it currently fails closed. The
critical risk is that repeated attempts can consume operator time, obscure the true failure, and
encourage bypassing the gate or making a public mutation without trustworthy evidence.

## Proposed Solution

### Approach

Add a single structured command-result and gate-evidence layer rather than adding ad hoc logging to
each stage:

1. Extend the subprocess result type with `status`, `signal`, `error`, `stdout`, `stderr`, start/end
   timestamps, duration, command, cwd, and an explicit failure class. Preserve Bun's raw summary
   lines and parse pass/skip/fail/error categories independently; never assume `fail + errors` is
   additive. Add a versioned receipt schema and canonical sorted-JSON manifest hash (SHA-256).
2. Execute read-only/local gate commands with streamed file-backed capture, preserving complete
   stdout/stderr in a versioned external transcript. Keep user-facing output concise and print the
   transcript path plus the first/last bounded failure summary. Finalize the transcript hash before
   atomically committing its receipt reference; incomplete pairs are never resumable.
3. Redact secrets before any transcript or receipt write. Redaction must cover current API/token
   names, quoted/unquoted values, Bearer/Basic authorization, npm auth output, and Git extraheader
   representations. Invalid encoding, redactor exceptions, or uncertain credential-shaped content must
   discard raw output and persist only a sanitized failure category.
4. Add atomic receipt writes (`temporary file → rename`) and a structured `gateAttempts` record.
   Include the exact command label, attempt, result class, manifest hash, transcript path/hash, and
   finalization marker without raw credentials. Resume validates `release-receipt/v2` and rejects
   legacy receipts lacking these fields.
5. Define a conservative gate policy:
   - first local gate failure is recorded and stops the release;
   - no automatic retries during public release execution;
   - an explicit diagnostic command may rerun local gates read-only and append attempts;
   - resume must require a fresh, successful gate evidence record for the current release HEAD;
   - mutation stages remain zero-retry and receipt-backed.
6. Add an atomic process-ownership lock for the version receipt/transcript. Record owner metadata,
   reject live-owner contention, and require explicit stale-lock evidence before recovery; concurrent
   processes must fail before mutation and must not overwrite evidence. The lock must include PID, host,
   process start time, version, mode, receipt path, and transcript directory.
7. Validate generated artifact state before and after build gates; distinguish ignored build output
   from tracked source changes and reject unexpected tracked changes before tag/push.
8. Preserve the existing `finally` restoration boundary, including failures in diagnostics and gate
   execution.
9. Keep npm first-publication handling explicit: package absence is allowed only for the first publish
   target; existing packages require access/ownership verification; all registry errors are classified.
10. Keep the GitHub REST and token-safe push policy unchanged except for structured result capture and
    redacted diagnostics.

This design intentionally does **not** auto-retry a failing test suite. A release should never turn a
flaky or unexplained assertion failure into a publish authorization merely because a later attempt
happened to pass. The operator may request a separate diagnostic run after reviewing the preserved
transcript.

### Steps

1. Add a RED-only diagnostic harness or test seam that reproduces the exact build → typecheck → test
   sequence without any release mutation.
2. Implement structured subprocess result classification, complete secret-safe transcript capture,
   bounded summaries, and atomic receipt writes.
3. Add gate-attempt persistence and current-HEAD/mode binding to resume validation.
4. Add an ownership lock and stale-lock recovery rules outside the repository.
5. Add tracked-artifact checks around generated SDK/build output.
6. Add unit/fixture tests for exit codes, signals, spawn errors, timeout, output truncation,
   redaction, atomic writes, lock contention, resume invalidation, and no-mutation behavior.
7. Run the exact build → typecheck → test sequence repeatedly in the diagnostic harness; classify the
   actual source of the contradictory outcomes with preserved evidence.
8. Update release documentation and parent FIDs with the final gate policy and evidence.
9. Run static checks and tests; have an independent audit review implementation and evidence before
   any release resume.

### Verification

The implementation is not complete until all of the following are independently evidenced:

- Unit tests cover normal exit 0, non-zero assertion failure, signal termination, spawn error,
  timeout, large output, secret redaction, and receipt/log atomicity.
- A test proves a failed gate leaves no tag, push, GitHub release, npm publication, or auto-resume.
- A test invokes the exact `bun run release:public:diagnose` manifest and proves it cannot reach
  mutation stages, while preserving complete redacted output for a fixture failure.
- A test proves a successful diagnostic gate is bound to the exact current HEAD, release mode, gate
  command set, Bun/npm versions, cwd, canonical manifest hash, and non-secret profile hash.
- A test invalidates the legacy pre-diagnostics receipt and rejects any transcript/receipt pair whose
  finalization marker, transcript hash, or schema version is missing or mismatched.
- A test proves a changed HEAD, mode mismatch, stale attempt, missing transcript, truncated transcript,
  redaction uncertainty, npm/network misclassification, invalid manifest hash, incomplete pair finalization,
  or lock contention blocks resume.
- A test proves a crash after auto-commit can recover only the exact expected release commit.
- A test proves settings/environment restoration on gate failure and restoration failure reporting.
- A fixture reproduces the release gate commands and preserves concrete failure blocks; helper-only
  tests are insufficient.
- A read-only npm fixture distinguishes first-publication HTTP 404 from authentication, network, and
  registry failures.
- Full project build, typecheck, test, ESLint, Markdownlint, Prettier, and diff checks pass.
- Call-graph search shows the structured runner is used by every gate command and no gate still uses
  the old unstructured failure path.
- Nova re-audits the completed implementation and grants fresh sign-off for both parent FIDs and this
  remediation FID.
- No public mutation occurs until all of the above are complete. FID-001/002 approvals remain
  suspended until FID-003 receives fresh Nova AUDIT and ADVERSARIAL sign-off.

## Perfection Loop

### Loop 1 — RED

- **RED:** The release was attempted under both approved FIDs but stopped before public mutation at
  `bun run test`. One release subprocess observation reported `2,845 pass / 18 skip / 37 fail / 9 errors`
  across 2,900 tests, while an independent exact-profile build → typecheck → test observation exited 0.
  The counts are not yet independently classified as additive, and timestamps/profile hashes were not
  persisted. The receipt contains only the generic failed-stage message and no structured transcript
  reference; the available logs were not surfaced with concrete failure blocks during diagnosis.
- **GREEN:** Proposed a universal structured subprocess/gate-evidence layer, conservative no-auto-retry
  policy, atomic receipts, external secret-safe transcripts with restrictive retention, lock ownership,
  npm/network classification, and current-HEAD/mode-bound diagnostic evidence. Public mutation remains
  blocked until the gate is deterministic and auditable.
- **AUDIT:** Pending implementation. No code was changed under this FID.
- **CHANGE DELTA:** FID-only specification; no production code delta.

### Missed Questions

1. **Should a later passing retry override an earlier failing gate?** → No. Preserve both attempts and
   require an explicit diagnostic decision; do not silently authorize mutation from a flaky pass.
2. **Should the release runner retry a failing test suite automatically?** → No. Automatic retries mask
   real regressions and created the current loop. Use a separate read-only diagnostic command.
3. **What evidence is required to classify a child failure?** → Exit code, signal, spawn error, command,
   cwd, environment profile hash (never raw values), complete redacted stdout/stderr, timestamps,
   duration, and attempt number.
4. **Can a large log be stored in the receipt?** → No. Store it in an ignored external transcript and
   keep only a bounded summary plus path/hash in the receipt.
5. **What if the process crashes during receipt write?** → Atomic replacement and recovery validation;
   a partial or mixed receipt is invalid and cannot resume.
6. **What if two release processes run concurrently?** → The second process fails before mutation on
   an ownership lock; stale locks require explicit, evidence-based recovery.
7. **What if build output changes tracked files?** → Abort before tag/push and list paths; ignored,
   regenerable outputs are not release-source changes.
8. **What if npm says a package is absent?** → Treat absence as valid only for first publication;
   authenticate separately and continue with package dry-run and publication checks.
9. **What if restoration itself fails?** → Exit non-zero, preserve the failure receipt, and expose only
   non-secret paths and restoration categories requiring operator action.
10. **What if a child hangs or is killed by the OS?** → Classify timeout/signal separately, terminate
    owned descendants where supported, persist evidence, and never retry or mutate automatically.
11. **What if a diagnostic command uses a different environment than release?** → Record a stable
    non-secret profile hash and command manifest; a diagnostic pass from a different profile cannot
    satisfy the release gate.
12. **What if the receipt says a stage completed but its transcript is missing?** → Invalidate the stage;
    completion without evidence is not resumable.

### Code Verification Evidence

- [x] Governing `ECHO-single-agent.md`, `dev/nova/specs/echo-v0.1.2-single-agent.md`, `ECHO.md`,
  `protocol.config.yaml`, TypeScript standards, architecture, and lessons were read end-to-end.
- [x] Current release runner and parent FIDs inspected.
- [x] Existing receipt and mutation boundary inspected.
- [x] Root package/test/build scripts inspected.
- [x] Independent exact-profile gate output inspected.
- [x] Structured runner implementation exists — `runReadOnlyGateManifest`
  (`scripts/public-release.ts:943`) drives all 8 manifest gates through `executeGate` (`:894`)
  with file-backed capture (`run`, `:797`) and atomic redacted transcripts
  (`writeRedactedTranscript`, `:380`).
- [x] Failure transcript and receipt tests pass — `32 pass / 0 fail` incl. tampered/missing
  transcript rejection (`validateResumeReceipt`, `scripts/public-release.ts:483`).
- [x] Full project gates pass through the new runner — real `--diagnose` run passes with
  `evidenceFinalized: true` at HEAD `7cb6184`.
- [x] Call-graph audit proves every gate uses structured execution — the release transaction and
  the diagnostic both construct the manifest via `buildGateManifest` (`scripts/public-release.ts:312`)
  and run each spec through `executeGate`; `runRequired` no longer executes gate commands.
- [ ] Nova AUDIT and ADVERSARIAL review — audit request drafted to `dev/nova/outbox/`
  (2026-08-08); external sign-off pending before FID-001/002 approvals are restored.

### Loop 2 — completed after implementation

- **RED (environment):** The workstation ran Bun `1.3.11` against a contract requiring `1.3.14`.
  The first diagnostic attempt under `1.3.11` was impossible by design (fail-closed preflight).
- **GREEN (toolchain):** Installed the pinned Bun `1.3.14` out-of-band via the official
  `install.ps1` script with `-Version 1.3.14 -NoPathUpdate -NoCompletions -NoRegisterInstallation`
  and `BUN_INSTALL=C:\Users\spenc\.bun-1.3.14`; the original `1.3.11` runtime remains untouched.
  All static gates and the focused suite pass under `1.3.14` (`24 pass` → now `32 pass` after the
  integration-seam additions).
- **RED (first classified failure):** `bun run release:public:diagnose` (run 1) failed with the
  generic worktree message; the then-current fingerprint hashed ALL ignored content, including a
  ʼ7.9 GB `resources/` directory and `node_modules`, and the `test` gate legitimately creates
  `cli/debug/output.txt` (gitignored; `cli/src/utils/logger.ts:180`, exercised by
  `cli/src/commands/__tests__/bash-command.test.ts:343`).
- **GREEN (contract narrowing):** Replaced the content-hash-everything fingerprint with a
  tracked-state fingerprint (`fingerprintWorktree`, `scripts/public-release.ts:2052`): tracked
  file content hashes + porcelain status of untracked non-ignored paths. Ignored-path deltas are
  now recorded as structured evidence (`ignoredPathDelta`, `scripts/public-release.ts:2109`;
  `ignoredPathList`, `:2121`) instead of blocking. Failure messages now list the exact changed
  paths (`changedWorktreePaths`, `:2089`; bounded to 50 in `runDiagnostic`, `:2168`). This matches
  FID edge case 7 (“distinguish ignored build output from tracked source changes”) and the
  handoff's open question 4 (narrower documented guarantee instead of an isolated worktree).
- **RED (concurrent mutation):** Diagnostic run 2 was rejected with the classified message
  `Diagnostic gates changed the tracked worktree (1 path(s): "docs/design/Savant Ecosystem
  Project Research.md")` — an untracked research artifact created by a concurrent process during
  the gate window (mtime `12:41:19`). The concurrency protection performed exactly as designed;
  the path-level classification made the failure actionable.
- **GREEN (external artifacts):** `docs/design/Savant Ecosystem Project Research.md` was exempted
  in `.markdownlintignore` per the repo's dated-artifact precedent (verified `bun run lint:md`
  exit 0).
- **RED (ADVERSARIAL, two latent bugs):** The new lock tests exposed two silent double-escaped
  regexes shipped by the previous session: `\\b` in the old process-tree probe and `\\d` in
  `acquireReleaseLock`'s owner `startedAt` validation (`scripts/public-release.ts:1486`). Both
  regexes matched literal backslashes, so the probe never detected survivors and stale-lock
  recovery could never succeed (always fail-closed). Fixed: single-escape `\d`; the stale-lock
  recovery test now passes (`scripts/public-release.test.ts` — `recovers a stale lock only with
  valid owner metadata and a dead PID`). A byte-level scan confirmed no other double-escaped
  regexes remain.
- **GREEN (Windows descendant cleanup):** Upgraded timeout cleanup from a root-PID probe to full
  owned-tree enumeration (`enumerateProcessTree`, `scripts/public-release.ts:693` via Win32
  process-table walk `processTableRows`, `:653`), `taskkill /T /F`, and per-PID survival
  verification (`terminateOwnedProcessTree`, `:726`). Stragglers are killed only after a fresh
  table read confirms they are still parented inside the owned tree (`killableOwnedSurvivors`,
  `:767`) so a PID reused by an unrelated process is never terminated.
- **AUDIT (double audit, two independent methods):**
  - Method 1 (static): `bun run typecheck` exit 0 (all workspaces); `bun x eslint
    scripts/public-release.ts scripts/public-release.test.ts
    scripts/process-tree.integration.test.ts --max-warnings 0` exit 0; `bun run lint:md` exit 0;
    `bunx prettier --check` pass; `git diff --check` pass.
  - Method 2 (runtime): `NODE_ENV=test bun test scripts/public-release.test.ts` → `32 pass / 0
    fail`; `NODE_ENV=test bun test scripts/process-tree.integration.test.ts` → `1 pass / 0 fail`
    (real child tree of 3 descendants terminated, every owned PID verified gone, 2.6 s).
  - Observable end-to-end: `bun run release:public:diagnose` under Bun `1.3.14` →
    **`Diagnostic gates passed`** with receipt
    `C:\Users\spenc\AppData\Local\Temp\savant-public-release-0.0.21-diagnostic.json`:
    `evidenceFinalized: true`, `failedStage: null`, `evidenceHeadSha: 7cb6184439…c78e9`,
    `gateManifestHash: 02178ed5b0332e699cfa6b5851f01e351bf6084e217ed9b320a9bc48b97619cb`,
    `ignoredChanges: {added: [], removed: []}`, and all 8 gate attempts `success` with complete
    redacted transcripts in `…\savant-public-release-0.0.21-evidence\`.
- **CHANGE DELTA (Loop 2):** FID updated with the converged evidence; production delta for this
  session is the fingerprint rewrite + process-tree upgrade + seam exports + tests
  (see `git diff --stat`).
- **Conclusion:** The original contradictory observation (release subprocess `37 fail / 9 errors`
  vs independent exit 0) is classified: under the pinned Bun `1.3.14` runtime the complete
  canonical manifest passes at the exact release HEAD with preserved, secret-redacted
  transcripts. The `1.3.11` runtime is the only known divergent input and the release contract
  correctly fails closed on it.

## Resolution

- **Lifecycle:** Investigation FID created; implementation converged through Loop 2 and verified
  end-to-end. Status moved from `analyzed` to `verified`.
- **Fix Description:** Universal structured gate layer with deterministic classification
  (success/exit/signal/spawn-error/timeout/evidence-error/malformed), file-backed redacted
  transcripts with SHA-256 + atomic receipt `release-receipt/v2`, resume validation against
  schema/HEAD/manifest/runtime binding, ownership-fenced release locks with working stale
  recovery, tracked-state worktree fingerprint with path-level failure classification and
  ignored-path delta evidence, and Windows owned-tree process termination with per-PID
  verification. Pinned Bun `1.3.14` installed out-of-band and the complete canonical gate
  manifest passes at the release HEAD with preserved evidence.
- **Tests Added:** 8 new unit tests (lock contention/stale recovery/invalid owner, diagnostic
  receipt builder, fingerprint changed-path reporting, ignored-path delta, no-mutation manifest
  contract, tracked-worktree fingerprint fixture) and 1 Windows integration test
  (`scripts/process-tree.integration.test.ts`, excluded from default runs).
- **Verified By:** Static gates (typecheck/eslint/markdownlint/prettier/diff) + runtime suite
  (`32 pass`) + Windows integration (`1 pass`) + real diagnostic run (`Diagnostic gates passed`,
  evidence finalized).
- **Commit/PR:** None for this FID (no-mutation boundary respected; working tree holds the
  implementation).
- **Archived:** Not archived — pending Nova AUDIT/ADVERSARIAL sign-off, then close + archive per
  the FID auto-archive rule.

## Lessons Learned

- Repeated release retries without durable failure classification are an ECHO circuit-breaker violation and
  an unsafe release practice.
- A generic subprocess error is not adequate evidence for a critical public mutation gate.
- A passing independent rerun does not explain a failing release subprocess; preserve both outcomes and
  diagnose the execution boundary before resuming.
- Release receipts must be operational evidence, not merely a list of completed stage names.
