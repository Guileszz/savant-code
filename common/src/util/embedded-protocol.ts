 * FID-2026-0810-002 Change 2 — embedded grounding-file provider.
 *
 * Serves the full harness grounding-set documents from the baked-in bundle
 * when the local files are absent (npm install in an arbitrary project). The
 * native `read_files` handler consults this provider when
 * `agentState.protocolSource === 'embedded'`: a requested grounding-set path
 * resolves from the bundle; every other path falls through to the normal
 * filesystem read. This keeps ONE enforcement path for every mode — the gate
 * is never pre-seeded, and the boot ritual stays real because the read
 * actually succeeds with the full document.
